            <h2>Why Appwrite</h2>
            <p>
                Because Appwrite feels like it's built by people who actually care about how developers <span
                    class="highlight">*feel*</span> when they use a tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like products that don't just ship features, but think about <span class="highlight">clarity,
                    learning, and the long-term relationship</span> with their users. Appwrite is open source,
                opinionated in a good way, and clearly trying to reduce complexity instead of adding to it. That matters
                to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also drawn to teams where documentation, writing, and collaboration are treated as <span
                    class="highlight">core work</span>, not side quests. From the outside, Appwrite looks like a place
                where good docs and developer experience are part of the product itself. That's exactly the kind of
                thing I want to help build.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a developer advocate who loves building communities and helping developers succeed. I believe in the
                power of open source, inclusive communities, and making tech accessible to everyone. When I'm not coding
                or creating content, I am playing with my nephew or watching anime.
